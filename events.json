    "description": "<br><br><p>Practice builds familiarity and confidence, and rehearsing a presentation in front of a low-pressure audience is a great way to gauge timing, troubleshoot technology, and make adjustments. This practice session invites all students to sign up to rehearse an in-progress speech or presentation online in front of a small and supportive group of peers and a writing advisor. Your presentation does not need to be polished or complete. <b>*Registration closes at 4:30pm on 5/16*</b></p><b>REGISTRATION LINK: </b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/warm-up-to-presenting-a-practice-session-tickets-1131154316009?aff=oddtdtcreator\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/warm-up-to-presenting-a-practice-session-tickets-1131154316009?aff=oddtdtcreator</a>"
