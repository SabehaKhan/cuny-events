This workshop provides information and tools to address and reduce speaking anxiety, so you can focus on developing your message and connecting with the audience. It also includes tips for structuring your presentation, choosing engaging visuals, and practicing effectively. This workshop is the first in a two-part series on presentations, which includes a practice session on 5/16.

    "description": "<br><br><p>Practice builds familiarity and confidence, and rehearsing a presentation in front of a low-pressure audience is a great way to gauge timing, troubleshoot technology, and make adjustments. This practice session invites all students to sign up to rehearse an in-progress speech or presentation online in front of a small and supportive group of peers and a writing advisor. Your presentation does not need to be polished or complete. <b>*Registration closes at 4:30pm on 5/16*</b></p><b>REGISTRATION LINK: </b><a href=\"https://www.eventbrite.com/e/warm-up-to-presenting-a-practice-session-tickets-1131154316009?aff=oddtdtcreator\">https://www.eventbrite.com/e/warm-up-to-presenting-a-practice-session-tickets-1131154316009?aff=oddtdtcreator</a>"
